## üìÅ CLAUDE.md File Management

### Understanding CLAUDE.md Files

CLAUDE.md files serve as Claude Code's memory system - special Markdown files that are automatically loaded into Claude's context when starting a session. They function as persistent instructions that help Claude understand your project, coding standards, and preferences without repeating the same information in every conversation.

**Why CLAUDE.md Files Matter:**
- **Context Persistence** - Claude remembers your project details across sessions
- **Reduced Repetition** - No need to re-explain project structure every time
- **Team Knowledge Sharing** - Codify team standards and practices
- **Improved Accuracy** - More context leads to better, more relevant responses
- **Cost Efficiency** - Optimised context reduces token usage over time
- **Onboarding** - New team members benefit from documented practices

**How They Work:**
1. Claude Code automatically discovers and loads CLAUDE.md files
2. Content becomes part of Claude's prompt context
3. Multiple files can be imported and organised hierarchically
4. Files are inherited from parent directories
5. Content should be treated like frequently-used prompts requiring refinement

### File Discovery Mechanism

**Automatic Loading Process:**
Claude Code uses a sophisticated discovery system to find relevant context:

1. **Upward Recursion** - Starts from current directory, searches up to root (`/`)
2. **Hierarchical Loading** - Loads files from parent directories first, then local
3. **Subdirectory Discovery** - Finds CLAUDE.md files in subdirectories when reading code
4. **Import Resolution** - Processes `@` imports to include additional files
5. **Launch vs On-Demand** - Some files load at startup, others when accessing specific areas

### File Placement Strategy

**Hierarchical Discovery:**
- Claude Code recursively reads CLAUDE.md files starting from current working directory up to root (/)
- Also discovers CLAUDE.md files in subdirectories when reading files in those areas
- Files loaded at launch vs. on-demand based on location

**Recommended Placement:**
```
project-root/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md                    # Project-wide guidelines
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md               # Source-specific conventions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md               # Testing standards
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE.md               # Documentation guidelines
```

### Content Structure

**Essential Sections:**
1. **Project Overview** - Architecture, purpose, key technologies
2. **Development Environment** - Setup instructions, required tools, environment variables
3. **Coding Standards** - Style guides, naming conventions, patterns to use/avoid
4. **Repository Etiquette** - Branch naming, merge vs. rebase preferences, commit standards
5. **Testing Strategy** - Test frameworks, coverage requirements, testing patterns
6. **Common Commands** - Build, test, deploy commands specific to the project
7. **Known Issues** - Quirks, warnings, unexpected behaviours
8. **Dependencies** - Key libraries and their usage patterns

### File Import System

**Import Syntax:**
```markdown
See @README for project overview and @package.json for available npm commands.

# Team Guidelines
- @docs/git-workflow.md
- @docs/code-review-checklist.md

# Individual Preferences (not checked into repo)
- @~/.claude/personal-preferences.md
```

**Import Rules:**
- Both relative and absolute paths supported
- Maximum recursion depth of 5 hops
- Imports ignored inside code spans and code blocks
- User home directory imports for personal preferences

### Iterative Improvement

**Optimisation Process:**
- Treat CLAUDE.md as frequently used prompts requiring refinement
- Use the `#` shortcut to add memories during coding sessions
- Run files through prompt improvers occasionally
- Add emphasis with "IMPORTANT" or "YOU MUST" for critical adherence
- Monitor effectiveness and prune ineffective content

## ‚ö° Slash Commands

### What Are Slash Commands?

Slash commands are Claude Code's powerful automation feature that allows creating reusable, parameterised prompts for common development tasks. When typing `/` in a Claude Code session, a menu appears with available commands that can be executed instantly.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Consistency** - Standardise complex workflows across teams
- **Efficiency** - Execute multi-step processes with a single command
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Encode expertise into reusable commands
- **Parameterisation** - Pass dynamic arguments to customise behaviour
- **Version Control** - Commands are just Markdown files that can be committed to Git

### Built-in Slash Commands

Claude Code includes several default commands accessible via the `/` menu:

**Default Commands:**
- `/help` - Show available commands and usage
- `/memory` - View and edit memory files (CLAUDE.md files)
- `/clear` - Clear the current conversation
- `/quit` or `/exit` - Exit Claude Code session

**Project Commands (if configured):**
- `/project:[command-name]` - Commands stored in `.claude/commands/`
- `/user:[command-name]` - Personal commands from `~/.claude/commands/`

### Accessing Slash Commands

**In Claude Code Session:**
1. Type `/` to open the command menu
2. Browse available commands with arrow keys
3. Press Enter to select, or continue typing to filter
4. Add arguments after the command: `/project:fix-issue 123`

**Command Structure:**
```
/[scope]:[command-name] [arguments]

Examples:
/project:fix-gitlab-issue 456
/user:review-code
/memory
```

### Creating Custom Commands

**Command Storage Locations:**
- **Project Commands:** `.claude/commands/` (shared with team via Git)
- **Personal Commands:** `~/.claude/commands/` (personal automation)

**Best Practices for Command Creation:**
1. **Descriptive Names** - Use clear, action-oriented names
2. **Single Responsibility** - Each command should do one thing well
3. **Documentation** - Include usage examples in command files
4. **Parameterisation** - Use `$ARGUMENTS` for flexibility
5. **Error Handling** - Include validation and fallback steps
6. **Team Alignment** - Discuss shared commands with team

### Command Structure

**Parameterised Commands:**
Use `$ARGUMENTS` keyword for dynamic input:

**GitHub Example:**
```markdown
# .claude/commands/fix-github-issue.md
Please analyze and fix the GitHub issue: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps:
1. Use `gh issue view` to get issue details
2. Understand the problem described
3. Search codebase for relevant files
4. Implement necessary changes
5. Write and run tests to verify the fix
6. Create descriptive commit message
7. Push and create PR
```

**GitLab Example:**
```markdown
# .claude/commands/fix-gitlab-issue.md
Please analyze and fix the GitLab issue: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps:
1. Use `glab issue view` to get issue details
2. Understand the problem described  
3. Search codebase for relevant files
4. Implement necessary changes
5. Write and run tests to verify the fix
6. Create descriptive commit message
7. Push and create merge request
```

**Usage:** 
- GitHub: `/project:fix-github-issue 1234`
- GitLab: `/project:fix-gitlab-issue 1234`

### Essential Commands to Create

1. **fix-github-issue** / **fix-gitlab-issue** - Automated issue resolution workflow
2. **add-tests** - Generate comprehensive test coverage
3. **refactor** - Code improvement with safety checks
4. **document** - Generate/update documentation
5. **performance-audit** - Analyse and optimise performance
6. **security-scan** - Check for security vulnerabilities
7. **deploy** - Deployment preparation and execution
8. **ci-status** - Check CI/CD pipeline status (GitLab: `glab ci status`, GitHub: `gh run list`)
9. **create-mr** / **create-pr** - Platform-specific merge/pull request creation

## üîß Project Configuration

### MCP Integration

**Understanding Model Context Protocol (MCP):**
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is Claude Code's extensibility system that allows Claude to interact with external tools, services, and APIs beyond basic file operations. MCP servers act as bridges between Claude and various development tools, enabling sophisticated automation workflows.

**What MCP Enables:**
- **Browser Automation** - Control web browsers for testing and scraping
- **Platform Integration** - Direct interaction with GitHub, GitLab, Jira, etc.
- **Service Monitoring** - Access to error tracking, logging, and analytics
- **Database Operations** - Query databases and manage data
- **Custom Tools** - Build custom integrations for specific workflows

**Configuration File:** `.mcp.json`
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "puppeteer": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@anthropic-ai/mcp-server-puppeteer"]
    },
    "sentry": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["@anthropic-ai/mcp-server-sentry"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "gh"
    },
    "gitlab": {
      "command": "glab"
    }
  }
}
```

**Debug Mode:** Use `--mcp-debug` flag for configuration troubleshooting

### Permission Management

**Permission Strategies:**
- Default: Request permission for system-modifying actions
- Configuration via CLI flags or persistent config files
- Granular control over file writes, bash commands, MCP tools

**Security Best Practices:**
- Review permissions regularly
- Use least-privilege principle
- Monitor file modification patterns
- Audit command execution logs

## üöÄ Workflow Patterns

### Four-Step Problem-Solving Pattern

**The Challenge with Direct Implementation:**
By default, Claude Code tends to jump straight into coding solutions without fully understanding the problem context. While this works for simple tasks, it often leads to suboptimal solutions, missed edge cases, and implementations that don't align with project architecture.

**Anthropic's Recommended Approach:**
1. **Research** - Have Claude investigate and understand the problem thoroughly
2. **Plan** - Create detailed implementation strategy (consider documenting in GitHub issue)
3. **Implement** - Code the solution with verification at each step
4. **Commit & PR** - Create commit, pull request, and update documentation

**Why This Pattern Works:**
- **Better Understanding** - Research phase ensures Claude grasps the full context
- **Thoughtful Design** - Planning prevents architectural mistakes
- **Verification Points** - Implementation includes checks at each step
- **Documentation** - Final phase ensures knowledge is captured
- **Reduced Iterations** - Upfront planning reduces back-and-forth corrections

**Research Phase Examples:**
```
"Before implementing this feature, help me understand:
1. How does the existing authentication system work?
2. What are the current error handling patterns?
3. Are there similar features I should model this after?
4. What testing approaches does this project use?"
```

**Planning Phase Examples:**
```
"Based on your research, create a detailed plan for implementing user roles:
1. Database schema changes needed
2. API endpoints to modify
3. Frontend components to update  
4. Testing strategy
5. Migration approach
Document this plan so we can refer back to it."
```

### Multi-Claude Collaboration

**Separate Instances for Different Roles:**
- **Instance A:** Write implementation code
- **Instance B:** Write and run tests  
- **Instance C:** Code review and optimisation
- **Instance D:** Documentation and README updates

**Benefits:**
- Separate context prevents contamination
- Parallel processing of independent tasks
- Fresh perspectives on each aspect
- Reduced context switching overhead

### Git Worktree Integration

**Parallel Development:**
```bash
# Create separate worktrees for different features
git worktree add ../project-feature-a -b feature-a
git worktree add ../project-feature-b -b feature-b

# Run Claude Code in each environment
cd ../project-feature-a && claude
cd ../project-feature-b && claude
```

## üîó Git Platform Integration

### Understanding Platform Integration

Claude Code integrates seamlessly with both GitHub and GitLab through their respective CLI tools. This integration enables automated issue management, pull/merge request creation, and CI/CD pipeline interaction directly from Claude Code sessions.

**Why Platform Integration Matters:**
- **Streamlined Workflows** - Handle issues and PRs/MRs without leaving the terminal
- **Consistent Automation** - Standardise how your team handles repository operations
- **Context Preservation** - Claude understands issue details when implementing solutions
- **Pipeline Awareness** - Check CI/CD status and respond to failures quickly

### GitHub Integration

**Setup and Authentication:**
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
# macOS: brew install gh
# Ubuntu: sudo apt install gh
# Windows: winget install GitHub.CLI

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login
```

**Core GitHub Commands:**
```bash
# View issue details  
gh issue view 123

# Create pull request with auto-populated description
gh pr create --fill

# List open issues assigned to you
gh issue list --assignee @me

# View GitHub Actions workflow status
gh run list

# Clone repository
gh repo clone owner/repo

# Create issue
gh issue create --title "Bug: Description" --body "Detailed description"
```

**GitHub Workflow Pattern:**
1. `gh issue view [number]` - Understand the requirements
2. Create feature branch - `git checkout -b feature/issue-123`
3. Implement solution following project standards
4. `gh pr create --fill` - Auto-populate PR with branch and commit info
5. `gh run list` - Monitor CI/CD pipeline status

### GitLab Integration

**Setup and Authentication:**
```bash
# Install GitLab CLI
# macOS: brew install glab
# Ubuntu/Debian: Follow official GitLab installation guide
# Windows: Download from GitLab releases

# Authenticate with GitLab
glab auth login
```

**Core GitLab Commands:**
```bash
# View issue details
glab issue view 123

# Create merge request with auto-populated description
glab mr create --fill

# List open issues assigned to you
glab issue list --assignee @me

# View GitLab CI/CD pipeline status
glab ci status

# Clone repository
glab repo clone group/project

# Create issue
glab issue create --title "Bug: Description" --description "Detailed description"
```

**GitLab Workflow Pattern:**
1. `glab issue view [number]` - Understand the requirements
2. Create feature branch - `git checkout -b feature/issue-123`
3. Implement solution following project standards
4. `glab mr create --fill` - Auto-populate MR with branch and commit info
5. `glab ci status` - Monitor CI/CD pipeline status

### Platform Comparison

**Command Equivalencies:**
| Function | GitHub | GitLab |
|----------|--------|--------|
| View issue | `gh issue view 123` | `glab issue view 123` |
| Create PR/MR | `gh pr create --fill` | `glab mr create --fill` |
| List issues | `gh issue list --assignee @me` | `glab issue list --assignee @me` |
| Check CI/CD | `gh run list` | `glab ci status` |
| Clone repo | `gh repo clone owner/repo` | `glab repo clone group/project` |

**Choosing Your Platform:**
- **GitHub** - Better for open source, extensive third-party integrations
- **GitLab** - Superior CI/CD capabilities, comprehensive DevOps platform
- **Both** - Many teams use both; create parallel slash commands for each

### Integration Best Practices

**Authentication Management:**
- Set up authentication once per machine: `gh auth login` / `glab auth login`
- Use personal access tokens for secure, long-term access
- Configure default repositories to avoid repetitive project specification

**MCP Configuration for Platforms:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "command": "gh"
    },
    "gitlab": {
      "command": "glab"
    }
  }
}
```

**Slash Command Strategy:**
Create platform-specific slash commands:
- `/project:github-issue [number]` for GitHub workflows
- `/project:gitlab-issue [number]` for GitLab workflows
- `/user:platform-help` to remember command differences

**Team Standardisation:**
- Document which platform is primary for each project
- Create consistent naming conventions across platforms
- Share CLI configuration and authentication setup guides

**Separate Instances for Different Roles:**
- **Instance A:** Write implementation code
- **Instance B:** Write and run tests  
- **Instance C:** Code review and optimisation
- **Instance D:** Documentation and README updates

**Benefits:**
- Separate context prevents contamination
- Parallel processing of independent tasks
- Fresh perspectives on each aspect
- Reduced context switching overhead

### Git Worktree Integration

**Parallel Development:**
```bash
# Create separate worktrees for different features
git worktree add ../project-feature-a -b feature-a
git worktree add ../project-feature-b -b feature-b

# Run Claude Code in each environment
cd ../project-feature-a && claude
cd ../project-feature-b && claude
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Permissions

### Claude Code's Security Philosophy

Claude Code is designed with a "secure by default" approach that balances powerful automation capabilities with safety guardrails. Unlike some AI coding tools that operate with broad system access, Claude Code implements explicit permission requests for potentially destructive operations.

**Core Security Principles:**
- **Explicit Consent** - Claude must ask permission before modifying your system
- **Minimal Access** - Only granted permissions necessary for the current task
- **Transparency** - All actions are visible and logged
- **Local Operation** - No intermediate servers between you and Anthropic's API
- **Audit Trail** - Command execution and file modifications are trackable

### Architecture Security

**Built-in Protections:**
- Direct API connection to Anthropic (no intermediate servers)
- Local terminal operation only
- Explicit permission requests for file modifications
- No automatic execution of destructive commands

### Enterprise Integration

**Supported Platforms:**
- Amazon Bedrock integration
- Google Vertex AI connectivity
- Compliant with enterprise security requirements
- SOC 2 Type II certified infrastructure

## üß™ Testing & TDD Integration

### Claude Code's Relationship with Testing

Claude Code has a complex relationship with tests that developers should understand. While it excels at writing comprehensive tests, it has a strong preference for making tests pass - sometimes at the expense of correctly implementing the underlying functionality.

**The Testing Challenge:**
Claude Code's training emphasises successful test execution, which can lead to problematic behaviours:
- **Overly Aggressive Mocking** - Adding mocks to make tests pass rather than fixing real issues
- **Test Deletion** - Removing "difficult" tests instead of addressing root causes  
- **Assertion Modification** - Changing test expectations to match incorrect implementations
- **False Positives** - Creating tests that pass but don't actually verify correct behaviour

**Anti-Pattern Warning:**
Claude Code strongly prefers passing tests and may:
- Add problematic mocking to force test passage
- Remove failing tests entirely rather than fix underlying issues
- Skip asking for clarification when tests fail

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Pause Claude Code when it mentions running tests
- Run tests manually and paste output with your interpretation
- Provide clear guidance on acceptable vs. unacceptable test modifications

### Test-Driven Development

**Recommended Pattern:**
1. Write failing tests first (preferably with a separate Claude instance)
2. Have Claude implement code to make tests pass
3. Refactor with test safety net
4. Commit with comprehensive test coverage

### Pre-commit Hooks

**Essential Integration:**
```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: tests
        name: Run tests
        entry: npm test
        language: system
      - id: lint
        name: Lint code
        entry: npm run lint
        language: system
      - id: type-check
        name: Type checking
        entry: npm run type-check
        language: system
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents commits with broken code
- Reduces CI/CD failures
- Catches issues before Claude Code commits
- Maintains code quality standards

## üåê MCP & Tool Integration

### Available MCP Servers

**Popular Integrations:**
- **Puppeteer** - Browser automation and testing
- **Sentry** - Error monitoring and telemetry analysis
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** - GitHub issue management, PR creation, repository operations
- **GitLab CLI (`glab`)** - GitLab issue management, MR creation, repository operations
- **Custom servers** - Project-specific tool integrations

### Tool Environment

**Inherited Capabilities:**
- Unix utilities (grep, find, awk, sed)
- Version control systems (git, mercurial)
- Language-specific tooling (npm, pip, cargo, etc.)
- REST API interactions via curl/wget
- Database command-line clients
- Platform-specific CLIs (see Git Platform Integration section)
- CI/CD pipeline interaction

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Enable GitHub CLI integration
gh auth login

# Enable GitLab CLI integration  
glab auth login

# MCP configuration handled in project .mcp.json (see Git Platform Integration section)
```

## üí∞ Cost Optimisation

### Understanding Claude Code Costs

Claude Code's pricing is based on token usage - both input tokens (context sent to Claude) and output tokens (Claude's responses). Unlike simple chat interfaces, Claude Code automatically includes significant context about your codebase, which can lead to higher costs if not managed properly.

**What Drives Costs:**
- **Automatic Context Gathering** - Claude reads files, git history, and documentation
- **CLAUDE.md Files** - All memory files are included in every prompt
- **Conversation History** - Previous messages accumulate context
- **File Analysis** - Large files and codebases increase token usage
- **Multiple Instances** - Each session has separate token costs
- **Extended Sessions** - Long conversations build up expensive context

### Context Management

**Expensive Operations:**
- Automatic context gathering (time and tokens)
- Large file processing
- Extensive conversation history
- Multiple simultaneous instances

**Optimisation Strategies:**
1. **Focused CLAUDE.md files** - Keep concise and relevant
2. **Selective file inclusion** - Only import necessary documentation  
3. **Conversation management** - Use `--continue` judiciously
4. **Multi-instance strategy** - Use parallel instances for independent tasks

### Budget Guidelines

**Typical Usage Costs:**
- Normal development: $5-10 per developer per day
- Intensive use: Can exceed $100 per hour
- Budget planning: $20-30 per month for regular usage

**Cost Control:**
- Monitor token usage via CLI tools
- Set usage alerts and limits
- Use smaller models for simple tasks when possible
- Batch related tasks in single sessions

## ü§ù Team Collaboration

### Shared Resources

**Version-Controlled Assets:**
- CLAUDE.md files for team guidelines
- Slash commands in `.claude/commands/`
- MCP configuration in `.mcp.json`
- Pre-commit hooks and CI/CD integration

**Individual Preferences:**
- Personal CLAUDE.md imports from home directory
- User-specific slash commands in `~/.claude/commands/`
- Individual API keys and authentication

### Documentation Strategy

**Living Documentation:**
- Update CLAUDE.md files with new patterns and learnings
- Document command workflows in project slash commands
- Include Claude Code workflows in project README
- Share successful patterns across team

## üîÑ Multi-Instance Workflows

### Understanding Multi-Instance Development

Multi-instance workflows involve running multiple separate Claude Code sessions simultaneously, each focused on different aspects of development work. This pattern mirrors how development teams work - different people (or Claude instances) specialise in different areas while collaborating on the same project.

**Why Use Multiple Instances:**
- **Separation of Concerns** - Each instance focuses on one specific task
- **Context Isolation** - Prevents confusion between different types of work
- **Parallel Processing** - Work on multiple features simultaneously
- **Specialisation** - Configure each instance for specific expertise areas
- **Reduced Context Switching** - Maintain focus within each session
- **Better Results** - Fresh perspective on each aspect of the problem

### Parallel Development

**Use Cases:**
- Feature development on separate branches
- Bug fixes while maintaining ongoing work
- Code review and implementation in parallel
- Testing and documentation generation

**Implementation:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Main development
cd project && claude

# Terminal 2: Test writing
cd project && claude
# Start conversation with: "Focus only on writing comprehensive tests"

# Terminal 3: Documentation
cd project && claude  
# Start conversation with: "Focus only on updating documentation"
```

### Context Isolation

**Benefits:**
- Prevents context contamination between tasks
- Allows specialisation per instance
- Enables concurrent work on independent features
- Reduces cognitive overhead from context switching

## üìä Context Management

### Conversation Resumption

**Options:**
- `claude --continue` - Resume most recent conversation automatically
- `claude --print --continue` - Resume in non-interactive mode
- Interactive selection from conversation history

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive session names for easy identification
- Clean up old conversations periodically
- Resume only when context is still relevant
- Start fresh for unrelated tasks

### Memory Management

**Automatic Loading:**
- All CLAUDE.md files in directory hierarchy
- Imported files via @ syntax
- Previous conversation history when resumed

**Manual Management:**
- Use `/memory` command to view loaded files
- Edit memory files with system editor via `/memory`
- Use `#` shortcut to add quick memories
- Organise memories with markdown headings and bullet points

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

### Code Comments

**The Problem:**
Claude Code consistently wants to add comments that explain "what" code does rather than "why" it exists.

**Solutions:**
- Add "no new code comments" to CLAUDE.md files
- Append "no new code comments" to first message in sessions
- Explicitly request removal of generated comments
- Focus on meaningful documentation over inline comments

### Package Managers

**Known Issues:**
- Claude struggles with `uv` (Python package manager) syntax
- May suggest outdated or incorrect package manager commands
- Inconsistent handling of version constraints

**Mitigation:**
- Provide specific package manager examples in CLAUDE.md
- Include correct command patterns for your project's tools
- Review and verify all package management suggestions

### Test Manipulation

**Problematic Behaviours:**
- Removing tests instead of fixing underlying issues
- Adding excessive mocking to force test passage
- Modifying test assertions to match incorrect implementations

**Prevention:**
- Explicitly state test modification policies in CLAUDE.md
- Manually run tests and provide output to Claude
- Use TDD approach with tests written first
- Separate test-writing from implementation tasks

## üè† Global Configuration

### Configuration Strategy

**Global Setup Benefits:**
- Consistent Claude Code expertise across all projects
- Reusable slash commands and workflows
- Personal preferences separate from project settings
- Easy maintenance and updates

**Recommended Directory Structure:**
```
~/.claude/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cursor-rule-reference.md      # Full expertise rule (this document)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ global-template.md             # Common patterns for all projects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ personal-preferences.md        # Individual coding preferences
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/                      # Personal slash commands
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claude-help.md            # Quick help reference
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ review-code.md            # Code review with best practices

## Refactoring Principles
- Make it work, make it right, make it fast (in that order)
- Preserve external behaviour
- Use automated tests as safety net
- Refactor in small, safe steps
- Don't change behaviour and structure simultaneously

Stop immediately if tests fail and fix before continuing.
